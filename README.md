# World-Air-quality-index-analysis-using-data-clustering-model
Overview: Project is about surveying air quality around the world using Python - Power BI - SQL Sever and building a prediction model through Unsupervisor: Clustering model, and Supervisor: Regression model and Classifier model
  - Air pollution is an important issue for public health and the environment. Among them, PM2.5 (fine dust with a size of less than 2.5 micrometers) and Ozone are among the factors that not only affect human health but also affect air quality in general.
  - Spatial analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone will help us better understand its distribution in the air, helping to make more specific policy decisions and solutions.
